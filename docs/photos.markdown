### Outdoor music-making - July 2021

This was the first communal music-making in over a year for some
members of the orchestra.  Weather forecasts were varied thus highly
unpredictable. In the event it didn't rain at all while we were
playing.  There was thunder, lightning and heavy rain half an hour
after we finished.  Just enough time to dismantle the green tent,
which is a nuisance to dry when it gets wet.

### Virtual Ensemble - December 2020
Some members of the Orchestra are showcased in this video playing
a movement from a piece of music we were rehearsing when the Covid-19
pandemic hit.  Many thanks to Chris Crosby for combining our
individual recordings into one performance.
