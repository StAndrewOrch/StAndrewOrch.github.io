## Who are we?

In the year 1878 two young amateur musicians, Arthur Christie and
Robert Shirar advertised in 'The Scotsman' for players interested
in forming an orchestra. The response being satisfactory, Christie,
who was a member of St Andrew's Church in George Street, applied
for permission to use the church hall for practices. His request
was met, a conductor was appointed and the orchestra was named after
the church.

The St Andrew Amateur Orchestral Society was founded in 1879 and
since its foundation, the orchestra has met regularly and has given
concerts every year since then.
